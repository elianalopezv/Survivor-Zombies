# Survivor-Zombies

My first game made with Unity. 
It's a basic idea. I must say this is my first project, so you will find some classic noob mistakes.
Let's have fun anyway!

## 1. What is Survivor-Zombies about?

After a zombie attack, one of them is trying to survive and he must find the way to escape from the city.
The only obstacle are the humans who will not hesitate to shoot when they see him. How can he achieve it then?

Collecting money and brains on the way!

Yes. When the zombie guy throws money to the human, he will stop shooting. And when the zombie eats a delicious brain, the lost health will be restored.


## 2. How Survivor-Zombies looks?

Yes. 3D or 2D art skills are not my best and I'm not proud of that. I know it can looks better.
I didn't count with the help of an artist, so I borrowed some assets from the Unity store and Internet.

When the application starts, the main menu appears. Quite simple. Let's click on Play!

After clicking play, we are ready to save our dear zombie friend from the terrible humans.

We move around using the W-A-D keys., or the arrows. It's easy, but be careful! Some unexpected shoots could reduce the health of our friend.

Hurry up! We need to find some money to distract those cruel humans.

Oh, but it's not that easy. You must know which is the last digit of the password for the ATM.

Then, drop the money in front of our shooter friend. He will go immediately for it and he will forget to kill you.

Hey, someone left his brain over there. This will restore the health of our zombie friend.

Now, find out the exit!
